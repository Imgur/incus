Incus
===

Incus was created by Imgur.com to be a real-time messaging server that acts as the
intermediary between a web app and a browser.

## How it's used at Imgur
Incus powers Imgur's real-time direct messaging, notifications (including iOS push), and
real-time point updates on all images and comments. It's currently processing over 1,000
events per second per machine, but can actually handle much more than that
(limits have not yet been identifed).

## Installation
For installation instructions, visit http://incus.io

## Native push notifications
We've recently added iOS push notification support to Incus (Android to come!) For more
information on how to set this up, please visit http://incus.io
